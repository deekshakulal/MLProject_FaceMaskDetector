# MLProject_FaceMaskDetector
Machine learing and deep learning based project which detects whether person wearing mask or not.
Used modules: tensorflow , keras,cv2 , mobileNetv2 and some basic modules.
Concept here is to train the machine using the datasets which are the images of people wearing mask and without mask.
Here the mobileNetV2 is used instead of CNN since it is lightweight and can be integreted into apps.
